Compile by typing "javac *.java" in the terminal, make sure you are in the folder where the file is.
Run by typing "java KochApp".

Then type a number into the gui text field and click the "Go!" button to see that number iteration of Koch Snowflake.

I could get to iteration 10 before my laptop crashed.
