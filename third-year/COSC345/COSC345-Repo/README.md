The following is how we tried to improve our app from the user testing results:

How would you rate the usability of the User Interface?

We received strongly positive feedback about the usability of the UI and therefore didn’t not change anything to address this

Was the app navigation easy?

We received strongly positive feedback about the navigation and therefore didn’t not change anything to address this

Was the UI attractive?

We received negative feedback about the UI therefore we added designs to the entire app to improve the attractiveness 

Was the app experience as expected?

We received strongly positive feedback about the user experience and therefore didn’t not change anything to address this

How long did you take on a minigame?

People took the amount of time we were hoping for during the minigames therefore we left the amount of questions in each game the same

Did you understand the questions?

We received strongly positive feedback about the understanding of the questions and therefore didn’t not change anything to address this

How interesting was the minigame?

We received moderate to good responses for how interesting the games were. Adding the UI designs we hoped would make them more interesting at it would be more aesthetically pleasing

Was there enough content per minigame?

We received strongly positive feedback about the content per minigame and therefore didn’t not change anything to address this

How understandable was the content provided?

We received strongly positive feedback about how understandable the content was and therefore didn’t not change anything to address this


Were the menus clear?

We received strongly positive feedback about if the menus were clear and therefore didn’t not change anything to address this

How effective was the lesson?

Our questions were repeating in the games therefore the feedback was that some questions were wasted in the games. After removing these repeating questions we hope that they will be more effective

Overall how would you rate the application?

We received high ratings for the overall of the app. 



Overall, we found that our lack of UI designs took away from the app. After fixing this we hope that we can provide a good user experience for our app
