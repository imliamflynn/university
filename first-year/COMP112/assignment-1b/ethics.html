            <h2>The Club's Code of Ethics</h2>
            <p>From <a href="www.communityrugby.co.nz/?file=D69BC7D5-5723-4F03-93D7163C18CFAD89">www.communityrugby.co.nz/</a>
            </p>
            <p>It is the aim of this hockey club to provide its members, both playing and non-playing, with quality service and facilities. In order to assist the club and to ensure that all members enjoy their visits to the club, it is important to set some ground rules with regards to what is acceptable behaviour and what is unacceptable behaviour, whether it is on or off the field.
            </p>
            <p>The essential elements of character-building and ethics in sports are embodied in the concept of sportsmanship and the six core principles:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Trustworthiness</li>
                <li> Respect</li>
                <li>Responsibility</li>
                <li>Fairness</li>
                <li>Caring</li>
                <li>Good citizenship</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Dealing with Breaches of the Club’s Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>As part of implementing a Code of Conduct, the club should also consider having a process in place to deal with any alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct. This may mean the club has to establish a small committee, similar to a ‘judicial committee’ to hear any alleged breaches. It is up to the club to decide who should be on this committee and how alleged breaches should be dealt with.
            </p>
            <p>As an example, a process may include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The complaint must be in writing, addressed to the club secretary and be received within a certain timeframe following the alleged incident, eg 48 hours or whatever the club agrees is appropriate.
                </li>
                <li>The committee will consider the alleged breach and all of the information available.</li>
                <li>The committee will set a date, time and venue for a hearing if it deems a hearing is necessary.</li>
                <li>Establish appropriate penalties for breaches, eg:
                    <ul>
                        <li> stand down from playing for a certain length of time, </li>
                        <li> suspension from the club, monetary fine or ultimately banned from being involved with the club at any level.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>All necessary parties will be advised of the decision verbally and in writing within a certain timeframe (club to decide appropriate timeframe).
                </li>
                <li>Appeal rights of either party (generally to be lodged and heard within a certain timeframe once a decision has been made).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is the responsibility of the club committee to set standards and provide guidelines for club members’ behaviour on and off the field. Once a Code of Conduct has been formulated, the committee should communicate this to all its members.
